# PhotoSharingApp
I learned to use Firebase while making this app
First of all, I uploaded the data entered by the user on the upload page to the firebase firestore.Then I showed the data I pulled from firebase to the user on the feed page.Once users log in, they are considered as logged in until they log out. logged in users access other pages (feed, settings, upload)
